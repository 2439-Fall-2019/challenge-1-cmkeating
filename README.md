The project I plan to deliver will have 5 pages. One main landing page with links to the other pages. One page that has a survey form in order for customers to fill out. Another page will allow customer to place reservations. Another  page will be a menu, pretty straight forward there. The last page will be a map showing our location. 

The first user was thouroughly unimpressed by my pages. They claimed navigation to be simple and straightforward but the aesthetics were lacking. I assigned them to find and select their favorite dessert. They did that very easily and selected cookies. They suggested streamlining the site and ironing out the kinks in the design.

The second user was impressed with the sitee. They liked how easy it was to navigate the site and that it wasn't cluttered with "useless things". I asked them to find and tell me the location of the Sage Student Bistro which they completed with ease. They suggested to add more functionality to the site like perhaps a more detailed location page with information on operating hours.
